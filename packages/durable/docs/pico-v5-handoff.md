# Pico5 implementation handoff

`packages/durable/docs/pico-v5.md` is normative. Implement this list in order.
After every package: run its tests, run `npm run check`, and stop for user review.
Do not redesign later packages while implementing the current one.

Pico3 is reference material only. Preserve useful behavior, not its capability
facades, membranes, document routing, view projection, events, or clone chains.

## Status

- Obsolete `pico` and `pico4` prototypes were removed.
- `pico3` remains.
- Packages 1–3 are implemented in `packages/durable`; later Pico5 runtime packages remain.

## 1. Records, cursors, and memory tables

Implement IDs, sequences, reserved root conversation ID `1`,
`ConversationRecord`, `EntryRecord`, strict input/write `SubmissionRecord`
values, live/terminal `TaskRecord` values, document records, storage writes, backend-opaque JSON cursors, and
detached `MemoryStorage` tables.
Reserve `Conversation` for the public conversation object, `Entry` for the typed
entry definition, and `Task` for the typed executable definition returned by
`defineTask()`.

Test reserved root identity and immutable creation, mixed atomic commits,
rollback, detached reads/writes, cursor boundaries,
fork-aware entry scans through deep ancestor caps, head lookup,
entry-to-commit lookup, full task replacement, and submission replacement/
request-ID lookup.

## 2. Memory document records

Add selected document base/delta writes, retirement, reincarnation,
current/as-of membership, exact logical-address lookup, scoped scans, and
materialized point-in-time reads. Storage keeps base/delta revisions private and
returns a detached value plus its stored definition version. It applies Chord
`Op[]` directly and receives no definition callbacks or unused candidate values.

Test Session-, conversation-, and task-scoped documents, half-open lifetimes,
create-plus-retire, retired historical membership, family queries, current-only
reclamation, version boundaries, detached ownership, and no scans of unrelated
document records.

## 3. SQLite backend

Implement the complete storage contract with ordinary rows and indexed document
records. Do not translate Chord operations into SQL JSON patches.

Run the memory conformance suite after reopen. Test SQL transaction rollback,
recent/ancient as-of reads, query plans, latest reclamation, WAL checkpointing,
deleted-page reuse, and representative storage sizes.

## 4. JSONL publication

Implement table writes in `main.jsonl`, one document sidecar per incarnation,
one sidecar per live task, and one main marker per commit. Do not add a
standalone-sidecar protocol. Serialization must also provide the storage ownership
boundary: retained indexes/materializations are detached from write arguments,
and reads never expose backend-owned cached objects.

Fault-test torn/short sidecar writes, failures between sidecars, every marker
boundary, unconfirmed tails, missing confirmed data, and poisoned writes.

## 5. JSONL reclamation

Implement task-document retirement and current-only base reclamation using
committed markers, temporary replacement, rename, and descriptor invalidation.

Crash-test every rewrite/rename boundary. Verify that rewindable history is
never reclaimed and default no-fsync behavior matches the specification.

## 6. Tracker transaction core

**Prerequisite:** Chord Delta exposes the normative `beginChange`/`prepare`/
`abort`/`adopt` tracker contract, including revocable async-lifetime drafts,
frozen operation batches, and deep no-op normalization.

Keep one Chord Delta tracker per loaded document. On first `tx.doc()` access,
call `tracker.beginChange()` and memoize its revocable copy-on-write draft by
logical address before awaiting acquisition. Repeated access returns that same
draft for the whole possibly async Session callback. On callback failure, abort
all changes. A callback that settles with an unresolved acquisition rejects;
seal `Tx`, drain and abort the acquisition, and observe its failure. Otherwise,
prepare every open change, then evaluate checkpoints and commit Storage. Only after Storage succeeds,
adopt every prepared tracker change and publish its candidate/ops directly.

Preparation and checkpoint errors roll back normally; an uncertain Storage
failure poisons the Session. Test callback failure, escaped-draft revocation,
concurrent duplicate acquisition, callback failure/success with a pending
acquisition, late acquisition after sealing, family first-seed wins, no-op normalization, multi-document preparation failure, storage
failure poisoning, immutable prior and candidate values, frozen operation
metadata, assignment copying, and unload/reload.

## 7. Document definitions and access

Implement scope-preserving singleton/family tokens and overloads for Session,
conversation, and task owners. Only `tx.doc()` is get-or-create: singleton tokens
supply `initial()`, while family calls always supply key and seed and use only the
first seed when absent. Snapshot, source, and watch lookup never create and return
`undefined` when absent. Definitions are explicit typed arguments, not registered
declarations; conflicting definitions claiming one persisted kind are unsupported
caller misuse.

Test concurrent initialization once, initial bases, detached snapshots, family
initializer use only on first creation, scope/token mismatch, non-creating reads,
terminal-task rejection, task-derived conversation identity, retirement, and
reincarnation-bound sources. Include create-task-then-document,
document-after-terminal rejection, and create-document-then-terminal settlement
in one transaction; internal candidate validation must not trigger
`ReadAfterWrite`.

## 8. Checkpoints and migration

After tracker preparation, Session evaluates `checkpointWhen(value, ops)` exactly once
for ordinary mutations and sends Storage only the selected base or delta.
Implement required creation/version bases and lazy all-older-version migration
on typed access; Harness open does not scan ordinary documents.

Test read-only in-memory migration, `tx.doc()` migration rollback and coalescing
with later edits, rewindable migration on current/historical read, the first
successful `tx.doc()` version base even without a JSON change, newer-version
rejection, migrated source/watch hydration without a write, subsequent operations
against that migrated baseline, stored-version fork copying, unaccessed and unavailable-definition
preservation, predicate failure rollback before Storage admission, and checkpoint
starvation without backend heuristics.

## 9. Conversation document forks

Using fixture conversations and entry-to-commit mappings, implement the `asOf`,
`current`, and `initial` settings for singleton and family documents.

Test opaque stored-version copying without definitions, retired membership, new
child incarnations, later lazy migration, lazy `initial` creation, and exclusion
of task- and Session-scoped documents.

## 10. Chord structural array operations

**Chord-owned prerequisite/integration:** the canonical Delta revision differ
must be fixed in `packages/chord`; Pico only verifies and consumes it.

Improve the canonical Chord Delta revision differ so ordinary positional
mutations encode scattered removals without carrying retained payloads. Callers
must not write operations manually.

Test front/tail/middle/scattered/all/no removal, retained 256 KiB and 1 MiB
payloads, append plus removal, later nested/index writes, exact replay, and
unchanged previous immutable snapshots. One prepared document change remains one
Session commit; no intermediate candidate is adopted or published.

## 11. Chord document source

**Prerequisite:** Chord exposes the normative atomic `ReplicatedStateSource`
attachment and `replicatedState(source)` adoption contract.

Make Chord replicated state adopt Pico's opaque committed document source through
a supported race-free source contract. It must atomically attach to the source's
current immutable value and later committed operations without another tracker
or re-diff. Pico remains the sole document mutator.

Test contiguous Chord delivery sequences, atomic hydrate/subscribe, a snapshot
that already covers a queued publication without duplicate application,
retirement between source acquisition and attachment hydrating `null` rather than
a replacement, retirement ending one incarnation, recreation requiring
reacquisition, and listener isolation. Reuse the transaction core's immutable
published value; do not materialize another document copy.

## 12. Document watches

Implement non-creating `watchDoc` as an incarnation-bound `WatchHandle` that
returns `undefined` when absent and atomically captures one fixed immutable value
while registering for later committed
operation batches. `start()` installs one serialized asynchronous listener.
Bound the pending queue only by the total number of operations in its undelivered
batches. Never estimate serialized bytes or call `JSON.stringify()` for delta
queue accounting. When the operation-count limit is exceeded, compact the entire
undelivered suffix into one root replacement using the matching latest immutable
published value from package 6; never retain a transaction draft or borrowed
storage candidate.

Test updates between acquisition/return/start; asynchronous consumer
initialization; no callback overlap; listener-initiated commits; compaction
before start and behind an in-flight callback; one over-limit commit batch;
repeated overload behind a pending reset; empty batches and repeated unchanged
view commits consuming no queue space; no serialization during queue accounting;
immutable earlier values; retirement before start and while active;
recreation; idempotent stop; second-start rejection; cancellation during acquisition;
cancellation/close during a callback; listener-error settlement; `closed`
self-join misuse; and invocation-owned
cleanup in package 15.

## 13. Conversations and entries

Implement conversation history/ownership records, entry creation,
conversation-bound cursor-based fork-aware scans, head lookup, and entry edits.
Expose public history pagination through `Conversation.entries()`, never through
`Harness`.

Test conversation creation and actual forks, deep ancestor caps, same-commit
entry prefixes, newest-edit wins, self-head resolution, raw head-to-tail
transcript, and ownership traversal.

## 14. Context derivation and system messages

Implement model-context reduction, PR #9548 positional `SystemMessage` replay,
tool-result ordering, and missing post-fork tool results. Replay `content`,
ordered named `sections` with `null` removal, then tool removals/additions.

Test model-less and excluded-stop-reason entries, replacements/omissions,
multiple heads, section replacement/removal/re-addition order, order-only
configuration changes between separate request preparations, rejection of
integer-like section keys, tool addition/removal/replacement order, and raw-view
versus model context.

## 15. Task definitions and invocations

Implement `defineTask`, exhaustive phase maps, full checkpoint replacement,
kind migration, runtime commits, memos, and invocation close gates.

Use a fake two-phase effect. Test intent/effect/outcome recovery,
unchanged-checkpoint faulting, same-phase checkpoint progress, cancellation
precedence, thrown-handler faulting, close/reopen without abort marks, outcomes,
or task-document retirement, no fresh phase/abort dispatch while closing,
first-writer-wins memos, and automatic watch cleanup.

## 16. Scheduler and terminal tasks

Implement reservation, running-task reopen reconciliation, dependencies,
terminal outcomes, waits, holds, joins, and orphaning.

Test result values and entry IDs, terminal records after reopen, dependency
eligibility, unknown kinds, and terminal removal of checkpoints/memos.

## 17. Abort and owned conversations

Implement durable abort marks, signal/join/fresh-abort invocation, owned
conversation creation, subtree traversal, background behavior, and idle waits.

Test commit rejection after a run task is marked, crashes at every abort stage,
close precedence over a previously marked task, deep ownership trees, atomic
retirement of task-scoped documents, default non-inheritance, inheritance from
the current committed tail, an empty source conversation, document fork
policies, and explicit model/section seed overrides.

## 18. Submissions and positional inbox

Define the initial inbox and turn-control documents, then implement strict input/
write `SubmissionRecord` variants, `Conversation.submit()`, request-ID
deduplication, awaitable/reacquirable submissions, busy admission, withdrawal, queue modes,
and `postTools`/`final` boundaries. Successful input settlement requires an
answer; write settlement means entry placement and never starts a turn. Use a fake successor
task.

Table-test every submission transition, cross-type request-ID conflicts,
interleaved steer/follow-up/write selection, self-head cuts, stale targets,
successor triggers, reopen waits, writes pending without a later boundary,
compact large-payload removals, abort results for queued/placed/terminal
submissions, and orphan/fault cleanup of active turn control.

## 19. Remaining built-in documents and view

Define the concrete configuration, preference, and live presentation documents;
reuse the approved inbox/turn definitions. Record all IDs, fields, history,
fork settings, migration, and checkpoint predicates in the normative
specification.

Implement `{ conversation, entries, docs }`. Test direct task writes, one
publication per Session commit, atomic
entry/preview settlement, head changes, contiguous revisions, stable public
paths, immutable acquisition snapshots, asynchronous consumer initialization,
serialized updates, reset compaction, retry/collapse late-join status,
bounded-output truncation metadata, and absence of semantic projection. Specify which
diagnostics become entries,
terminal details, or bounded document state.

## 20. Registries, hooks, and sections

Implement task/tool/section registries, Session and owned-subtree hooks,
positional PR #9548 section/tool updates, complete baselines after a head cut,
and preparation revision checks. Do not add a Session-kernel semantic event
journal or extension-state router; package 24 adds the thin product notification
adapter from specification §9.4.

Test registration lifetimes, hook replay with memos, exact persisted rendered
section strings, minimal section patches and `null` removals, complete baseline
tool declarations, and a head cut that retains earlier system messages. Verify
the new baseline entry omits those messages through `ContextEdit` before replay,
including retained `content`, section order, and tool changes. Include a retained
delta whose ID precedes the head-carrying entry: select omissions by retained
context membership, not an ID comparison with the head entry. Test tool loadout
additions/removals and preparation retry after registry movement. Do
not implement in-process replacement of Session-side extension code; a host extension
change uses the Harness close/reopen boundary.

## 21. Tool and post-tools tasks

Implement offered-set checks, argument validation, tool hooks, durable bounded
progress, owned APIs, interrupted/replay-safe recovery, result entries,
post-tools joining, controls, and boundaries using fake tools.

Test recovery from every phase, both stored/current replay-policy directions,
default and overridden bounds, streamed-content fallback, progress replacement
and coalesced commit settlement, drain-before-terminal ordering,
abort/close with buffered output, invocation-bound owned handles, and atomic
assistant/tool/post-tools settlement. Use a fake
generation successor; package 22 replaces it and reruns integration.

## 22. Generation task

Implement preparation, request intent, durable throttled partials, attempts,
retry policy, response classification, continuation, and deferred polling/
cancellation through pi-ai's exported `Models` interface. Do not add a Pico
model adapter. The faux test double implements that same interface.

Test every phase before and after reopen, aborted partial conversion, overflow
through a fake collapse kind, input-submission settlement, and no visible-undurable update.
Replace the fake tool successor and rerun the package 21 integration tests.

## 23. Collapse task

Implement manual, threshold, and overflow collapse; exchange-boundary range
selection; summarization; retries; staleness; and headed summary entries.

Test context before/after collapse, provider failure, declined/stale work, and
reopen from every phase. Replace generation's fake overflow target and rerun its
overflow integration test.

## 24. Harness integration

Implement the exact public surface in specification §2.2:
`Harness.open/resume/suspend/close`, lifecycle gates, root/create/lookup
`Conversation` objects, typed input/write `submit()` and `Submission` objects,
conversation-bound commits and history pagination, fork/collapse/reset/abort/idle,
typed task wait/abort, generic document access, task/tool/section registries, and
structural conversation watches. Do not restore Pico3's
namespace router, fixed document accessors, semantic view events, or manual Chord
view bridge.

Expose service withdrawal/client detach and product wiring. Implement the §9.4
agent-mode notification adapter directly from uncoalesced committed publication,
without another tracker or persistence authority. Migrate TUI hydration to the
structural conversation watch, make print await its own input `Submission`, and expose
JSON/RPC correlated commands plus ordered committed notifications. Test that
watch reset compaction cannot erase a subscribed notification lifecycle, late
clients use structural hydration rather than event replay, progress notifications
reflect durable throttled state rather than every provider frame, and stdout
backpressure/disconnect policy stays in the mode adapter.

Implement the v1 host-extension reload path as stop admission, close/join, dispose,
rebuild with new document tokens and registered task/tool/section definitions, reopen/migrate live tasks, and resume. Ordinary documents migrate
on later typed access. Test that closing seals commit and
mutation admission, lets storage settlement for already-prepared admitted
commits finish despite caller cancellation, stops watches, joins in-flight watch
callbacks and task/tool/hook invocations outside the Session line, writes no abort
or terminal outcome, starts no fresh abort invocation, and does not run old and
new generations concurrently. Include cancellation during watch acquisition and
a non-cooperative watch callback in shutdown/extension-reload quiescence tests.

Test stable persisted root identity; atomic conversation/config/section/input-
submission creation; default `"off"` thinking; every configuration getter/setter; explicit
active-tool seed duplicate/unregistered rejection; default active registry
snapshot; as-of fork inheritance including unavailable historical names; durable
`missing_active_tool` settlement; fork seed overrides; concrete-entry forks;
collapse task-ID return;
busy reset admission and later placement; mark-only versus signalling abort;
conversation abort/join with surviving passive writes and background tasks;
quiescence with eligible work; listener initial/future delivery and isolation;
and runtime registration between open and resume without resurrection of a task
settled during open.

Compile-test every §2.2 and §3 owner/key/seed overload plus the usage sequences
in the normative specification and Chord guide. Verify that a Chord root
replacement delta remains distinct from a Session-selected storage checkpoint. The erased registry test must include a concrete task with narrowed
input, multiple checkpoint phases, and custom hooks. Run all package-specific
tests and the repository check. Verify a local
coding-agent turn and a reopened interrupted turn, then stop for final review.
